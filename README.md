Hi, my name is Kirill Shurshev and this is the trading application that was build during the trading course. 
The App support automated exchange API within Binance and Bitmex that are two of the most popular crypto exchanges in the world, they provide awesome automation possibilities and are great for beginners. 

The graphical interface is divided into 3 parts:
1) The left part of the interface allows you to see the current demand of all cryptocurrencies on bitmax and binans.
2) The right part shows cryptocurrency strategies and trading. You can choose between two strategies: Execution, which calculates exponential moving average signals, and break out strategy.
3) Also under the strategies are presented trading statuses, which include such parameters as time, symbol, strategy, amount and status.

Some interesting enhancements for the GUI:
-Scrollable frames
-Autocompletion of cryptocurrency names
-Saving interface data through SQLite database
-Data validation for entering startegy parameters like integers or floats.
-Starting the app outside of the IDE
-Closing the app
-Logs information
